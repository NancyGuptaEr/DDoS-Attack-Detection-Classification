# DDoS-Attack-Detection-Classification

• Conducted exploratory data analysis on a SDN network traffic dataset to understand its characteristics and detect anomalies
• Evaluated 8 classification algorithms; Random Forest achieved highest accuracy in distinguishing benign from malicious traffic
• Developed robust DDoS attack detection model in SDN environments, focussing on key features- packet count, flow duration
